<h3>Hi there, I'm Shuo Huai.</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the College of Computing and Data Science, <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanyang Technological University</a> (NTU), Singapore, working with <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/junluo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Jun Luo</a>. My research focuses on secure and efficient AI, with an emphasis on adversarial attacks and defenses, efficiency in edge AI systems, and large language models (LLMs).
